/*
   Package zsh contains command line utilities designed for use with zsh on macOS.
   It is likely that nearly all of these utilities will work correctly on any shell and
   in any environment, but are not exhaustively tested.

   Examples of utilities available:

   • `binit` creates links to command line tools in ~/bin to provide path access

   • `gofind` searches for files and directories matching a pattern

   • `ls` lists files and directories in a directory

   • `tree` creates a typical visual tree of directories and files
